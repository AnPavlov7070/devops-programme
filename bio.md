# Professional Background
# I've participated recently in an interesting project - I travelled to Estonia, Finland and Latvia to build and prepare servers for deployment - mounting switches, fibers, ensuring proper power and grounding components in data centers. Also I was responsible to coordinate a remote access to the team that was configuring the software setup and network integration.
# My main job now is to provide local tech support to my colleagues in Bulgaria, who are doing mainly BPO projects for different clients at out company. The support is mainly on Windows OS and as admin I have to be familiar not only with the OS, but also with the client's corporate applications and how to trobleshoot them. Aside the desktop support, I assist with maintaining a server on-site, maintaining every PC in the company, printers, routers and phones. Also I do a lot of documentation about assets, configurations, writing some scripts sometimes for automatization, upgrades, and disaster recovery activities.
# On my previous company I did less things then now, but with the difference that before I was leading IT security trainings for every new colleague joining the company, so he/she could have been familiar with the rules, security and apps we were using.
